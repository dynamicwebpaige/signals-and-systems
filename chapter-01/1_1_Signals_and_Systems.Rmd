## **Signal Classifications and Properties**

------

### _Introduction_
This module will begin our study of signals and systems by laying out some of the fundamentals of signal classification. It is essentially an introduction to the important definitions and properties that are fundamental to the discussion of signals and systems, with a brief discussion of each.

## **Classification of Signals**

------

### _Continuous-Time vs. Discrete Time_
As the names suggest, this classification is determined by whether or not the time axis is **discrete** (countable) or **continuous** (*Figure 1.1*). A continuous-time signal will contain a value for all real numbers along the time axis. In contrast to this, a discrete-time signal, often created by sampling a continuous signal, will only have values at equally spaced intervals along the time axis.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
f <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0,10)), aes(x))
f + stat_function(fun = sin, colour = "blue") + xlab("Fig. 1.1: Continuous Function") + ylab("")
```

### _Analog vs. Digital_
The difference between **analog** and **digital** is similar to the difference between continuous-time and discrete-time. However, in this case the difference involves the values of the function. Analog corresponds to a continuous set of possible function values, while digital corresponds to a discrete set of possible function values. A common example of a digital signal is a *binary sequence*, where the values of the function can only be one or zero.

``` {r echo = FALSE}
d = data.frame(x = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4), y = c(0, 1, 1, 0, 0))
ggplot() + geom_step(data = d, mapping=aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  ylab("") + xlab("Figure 1.2: Step Function")
```

### _Periodic vs. Aperiodic_
Periodic signals (Section 6.1) repeat with some **period** $T$, while aperiodic, or nonperiodic, signals do not ($Figure 1.3$). We can define a periodic function through the following mathematical expression, where $i$ can be any number and $T$ is a positive constant: 

$$ f(t) = f(t + T) $$

The **fundamental period** of our funcion, $f(t)$, is the smallest value of $T$ that still allows (1.1) to be true.

### _Finite vs. Infinite Length_
Another way of classifying a signal is in terms of its length along its time axis. Is the signal defined for all possible values of time, or for only certain values of time? Mathematically speaking, $f(t)$ is a **finite-length signal** if it is **defined** only over a finite interval.

$$ t_{1} < t < t_{2} $$

where t1 < t2. Similarly, an **infinite-length signal**, f(t), is defined for all values:

$$ -\infty < t < \infty $$

### _Causal vs. Anticausal vs. Noncausal_
**Causal** signals are signals that are zero for all negative time, while **anticausal** are signals that are zero for all positive time. **Noncausal signals** are signals that have unzero values in both positive and negative time ($Figure 1.4$).

### _Even vs. Odd_
An **even signal** is any signal $f$ such that $f(t) = f(-t)$. Even signals can be easily spotted as they are **symmetric** around the vertical axis. An **odd signal**, on the other hand, is a signal $f$ such that $f(t) = -f(-t)$ ($Figure 1.5$).

Using the definitions of even and off signals, we can show that any signal can be written as a combination of an even and odd signal. That is, every signal has an odd-even decomposition. To demonstrate this, we have to look no farther than a single equation.

$$ f(t) = \frac{1}{2} (f(t) + f(-t)) + \frac{1}{2} (f(t) - f(-t)) $$

By multiplying and adding this expression out, it can be shown to be true. Also, it can be shown that $f(t) + f(-t)$ fulfills the requirement of an even function, while $f(t) - f(-t)$ fulfills the requirement of an odd function ($Figure 1.6$).

### _Deterministic vs. Random_
A **deterministic signal** is a signal in which each value of the signal is fixed, being determined by a mathematical expression, rule, or table. On the other hand, the values of a **random signal** are not strictly defined, but are subject to some amount of variability.
