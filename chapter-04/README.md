## 4.1 Discrete Time Systems
As you already now know, a discrete time system operates on a discrete time signal input and produces a discrete time signal output. There are numerous examples of useful discrete time system in digital signal processing, such as digital filters for images or sound. The class of discrete time systems that are both linear and time invariant, known as discrete time LTI systems, is of particular interest as the properties of linearity and time invariance together allow the use of some of the most important and powerful toos in digital signal processing.

## 4.2 Discrete Time Impulse Responses
The output of a discrete time LTI system is completely determined by the input and the system's response to a unit impulse.

## 4.3 Discrete Time Convolution
Convolution, one of the most important concepts in electrical engineering, can be used to determine the output a system produces for a given input signal. It can be shown that a inear time invariant system is completely characterized by its impulse response. The sifting property of the discrete time impulse function tells us that the input signal to a system can be represented as a sum of scaled and shifted unit impulses. Thus, by linearity, it would seem reasonable to compute of the output signal as the sum of scaled and shifted unit impulse responses. That is exactly what the operation of convolution accomplishes. Hence, convolution can be used to determine a linear time invariant system's output from knowledge of the input and the impulse response.
