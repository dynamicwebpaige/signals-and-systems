# Signals and Systems: Visual Accompaniment

> "The techniques and applications of digital signal processing are expanding at a tremndous rate, ... and the importance of digital signal processing appears to be increasing with no visible sign of saturation. Indeed, the future development of the field is likely to be even more dramatic than the course of development we have experienced, to date."

> from *Digital Signal Processing*, by Alan V. Oppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer

The purpose of this repository is to provide visual accompaniments to the open-source textbook *Signals and Systems* (Richard Baraniuk et al). All images, HTML files, and interactive visualizations are created using R.
